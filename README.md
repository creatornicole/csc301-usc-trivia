CSC301 2023 Assignment 1 - Front-end development

## Task description
You have been asked to develop a trivia web application with the following components:
- A home page that allows the participant to enter a name
- The trivia page needs to display each question (one at a time) and their options. This page must have a timer that will start as soon as the trivia page is loaded and will stop as soon as the last question has been answered
- The final page needs to display the name of the participant, their score and the total time

### Required technologies
- You must develop this web application using HTML, CSS and Typescript
- You have to use a CSS framework (e.g., bootstrap, tailwind, etc.)
- The typescript files have to be compiled to JavaScript
- You have to get the questions from the following API (https://usc-trivia.azure-api.net/trivia?subscription-key=14f11421203e4f67a099919a3fd941c6)
- For development and testing please use the testQuestions JSON file as the API is a free version and has a maximum number of calls per month. Once you have your code working replace it with a call to the API
